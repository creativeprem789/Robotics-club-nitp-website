🤖 Robotics Club NIT Patna - Official Website

A modern, fully responsive web platform with an intuitive admin dashboard for seamless content management

🌐 Live Demo: https://itzboris.github.io/Robotics/ | 📹 Video Walkthrough

🌟 What Makes This Special While meeting all 8-page requirements for the Robotics Club challenge, this project goes beyond the brief with a custom-built Admin Dashboard - a complete frontend content management solution. 🎯 Key Highlight: Admin Dashboard

✨ Add/Edit/Delete events, projects, and achievements through an intuitive interface 💾 Uses browser localStorage for instant updates (backend-ready architecture) 🎨 Clean, user-friendly interface for non-technical club members 🔄 Real-time content updates without touching code 📱 Fully responsive admin panel

Why This Matters Most static websites require developer intervention for every content update. This solution empowers club coordinators to manage content independently, with a structure that's ready for backend integration when needed.WhatsApp Image 2026-01-15 at 18 49 55 Uploading WhatsApp Image 2026-01-15 at 18.49.55.jpeg…

🛠️ Technology Stack Core Technologies

HTML5: Semantic markup, proper structure, accessibility attributes CSS3: Custom properties (variables), Grid, Flexbox, animations, transitions Vanilla JavaScript ES6+: Modules, arrow functions, template literals, async/await

Why No Frameworks? Zero Build Process: Write code, open in browser, it works. No npm install, no webpack, no compilation. Pure Understanding: Every line of code is intentional. No magic happening behind the scenes. I know exactly what my code does. Performance: No framework bloat. The entire site (including admin dashboard) is under 500KB total. Maintenance: No dependency updates, no security vulnerabilities from npm packages, no breaking changes. Learning Value: Understanding DOM manipulation, event delegation, and state management from scratch is invaluable. CSS Architecture

Methodology: BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention Organization:

main.css - Global styles, reset, variables components.css - Reusable components (buttons, cards, modals) pages.css - Page-specific styles responsive.css - Media queries admin.css - Admin dashboard styles

Features Used:

CSS Custom Properties for theming CSS Grid for layouts Flexbox for components CSS Animations and Transitions Media Queries for responsiveness Transform and Filter effects
