A modern, fully responsive web platform with an intuitive admin dashboard for seamless content management

🌐 Live Demo: https://itzboris.github.io/Robotics/ | 📹 Video Walkthrough

🌟 What Makes This Special While meeting all 8-page requirements for the Robotics Club challenge, this project goes beyond the brief with a custom-built Admin Dashboard - a complete frontend content management solution. 🎯 Key Highlight: Admin Dashboard

✨ Add/Edit/Delete events, projects, and achievements through an intuitive interface  Uses browser localStorage for instant updates (backend-ready architecture) 🎨 Clean, user-friendly interface for non-technical club members  Real-time content updates without touching code  Fully responsive admin panel

Why This Matters Most static websites require developer intervention for every content update. This solution empowers club coordinators to manage content independently, with a structure that's ready for backend integration when needed.


✨** Core Features**  Admin Dashboard (Our Standout Feature) Event Management

Create upcoming events with date, time, venue, and descriptions Upload event images and posters Mark events as ongoing or move to past events Edit or delete existing events Generate registration links automatically

🛠️ Technology Stack Core Technologies

HTML5: Semantic markup, proper structure, accessibility attributes CSS3: Custom properties (variables), Grid, Flexbox, animations, transitions Vanilla JavaScript ES6+: Modules, arrow functions, template literals, async/await

Why No Frameworks? Zero Build Process: Write code, open in browser, it works. No npm install, no webpack, no compilation. Pure Understanding: Every line of code is intentional. No magic happening behind the scenes. I know exactly what my code does. Performance: No framework bloat. The entire site (including admin dashboard) is under 500KB total. Maintenance: No dependency updates, no security vulnerabilities from npm packages, no breaking changes. Learning Value: Understanding DOM manipulation, event delegation, and state management from scratch is invaluable. CSS Architecture

Methodology: BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention Organization:

main.css - Global styles, reset, variables components.css - Reusable components (buttons, cards, modals) pages.css - Page-specific styles responsive.css - Media queries admin.css - Admin dashboard styles

Features Used:

CSS Custom Properties for theming CSS Grid for layouts Flexbox for components CSS Animations and Transitions Media Queries for responsiveness Transform and Filter effects
